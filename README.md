Allows multitouch control of Windows using a Leap Motion controller together with a transparent touch surface

My goal was to implement an idea I had at the time: multitouch control of Windows that works similar to a trackpad, except the fingertip positions are tracked in 3D space above the trackpad surface and displayed on screen as "touch cursors".

See video demos for a clearer picture of how it works.
